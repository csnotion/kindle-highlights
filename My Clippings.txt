If that’s hard to believe, make a list of the following: • Everything you have intensely worried about in your life. Go back as many years as you can, and be as detailed as you can. • Every difficult situation you swore you would never get through or never get over. • Every time you have genuinely felt happy and at peace.

‘At the beginning of a game, there are no variations. There is only one way to set up a board. There are nine million variations after the first six moves. And after eight moves there are two hundred and eighty-eight billion different positions. And those possibilities keep growing.

In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’
